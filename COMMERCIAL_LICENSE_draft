AIdea Commercial License Agreement

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between [Your Company/Your Name] ("Licensor") and the entity or individual agreeing to these terms ("Licensee").

1. License Grant
The Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right to use the AIdea web application ("Software") for commercial purposes, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Sublicensing is prohibited, except as expressly agreed upon through license negotiation.

2. Term and Renewal
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and remain in force for a period of one (1) year. It shall automatically renew annually on similar terms unless the Licensee opts for modifications, subject to renegotiation and adherence to any new pricing structures established. The Licensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement for any breach of its terms, with the option to waive such breach at its discretion. The Licensor shall provide the Licensee with a 90-day written notice of any pricing changes. Feedback from commercial licensees is encouraged to help establish a reasonable pricing structure.

3. Support and Updates
The Licensee will receive prioritized support on GitHub issues, notifications of bug fixes, updates, or patches, and access to other support channels as established and published by the Licensor. However, such support is offered 'as-is' and is not guaranteed.

4. Use Cases
Licensee is permitted to host the Software for commercial purposes and modify it as part of a larger commercial project. Modifications to the core functionality of the Software require prior approval through negotiation. Significant changes, as determined by the Licensor, may affect the Licenseeâ€™s eligibility for "powered by AIdea" branding discounts.

5. Pricing Structure
The official pricing structure will be established upon the Software reaching version 1.0. Until then, commercial licensing of pre-1.0 versions is subject to negotiation. The Licensor welcomes input from potential licensees on developing a future pricing structure.

6. Prohibitions
The Licensee is expressly prohibited from creating derivative works that compete with the original Software and from reselling the Software or its components. However, reverse engineering is not prohibited.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. The Licensor shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character. Liability under this Agreement is limited to the amount paid by the Licensee.

8. Integration with Open-Source License
[This section to be discussed with legal counsel regarding open-source integration.]

9. Termination
The Licensor may terminate this Agreement with cause, or refuse renewal without cause, provided a 90-day notice is given. The Licensee may terminate this Agreement with a 30-day written notice and shall be entitled to a 50% refund of the prorated license fee for the remaining term. Upon termination, the Licensee must cease using the Software by 6 AM UTC the following day.

10. Audit Rights
The Licensor reserves the right to audit the Licensee's use of the Software to ensure compliance with this Agreement.

11. Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution
[To be determined in consultation with legal counsel.]

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.
