AIdea Commercial License Agreement

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between [Your Company/Your Name] ("Licensor") and the entity or individual agreeing to these terms ("Licensee").

1. License Grant
The Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right to use the AIdea web application ("Software") for commercial purposes, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Sublicensing is prohibited, except as expressly agreed upon through license negotiation.

2. Term and Renewal
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and remain in force for a period of one (1) year. It shall automatically renew annually on similar terms unless the Licensee opts for modifications, subject to renegotiation and adherence to any new pricing structures established. The Licensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement for any breach of its terms, with the option to waive such breach at its discretion. The Licensor shall provide the Licensee with a 90-day written notice of any pricing changes. Feedback from commercial licensees is encouraged to help establish a reasonable pricing structure.

3. Support and Updates
The Licensee will receive prioritized support on GitHub issues, notifications of bug fixes, updates, or patches, and access to other support channels as established and published by the Licensor. However, such support is offered 'as-is' and is not guaranteed.

4. Use Cases
Licensee is permitted to host the Software for commercial purposes and modify it as part of a larger commercial project. Modifications to the core functionality of the Software require prior approval through negotiation. Significant changes, as determined by the Licensor, may affect the Licenseeâ€™s eligibility for "powered by AIdea" branding discounts.

5. Pricing Structure
The official pricing structure will be established upon the Software reaching version 1.0. Until then, commercial licensing of pre-1.0 versions is subject to negotiation. The Licensor welcomes input from potential licensees on developing a future pricing structure.

6. Prohibitions
The Licensee is expressly prohibited from creating derivative works that compete with the original Software and from reselling the Software or its components. However, reverse engineering is not prohibited.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. The Licensor shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character. Liability under this Agreement is limited to the amount paid by the Licensee.

8. Integration with Open-Source License

a. Dual Licensing Structure: AIdea is available under two distinct licensing models: the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) for open-source and non-commercial use, and a separate Commercial License for commercial purposes. The choice of license depends on the user's intended use of the Software.

b. Derivative Works: Derivative works created by the Licensee under the Commercial License are subject to the terms of this Agreement. If the Licensee opts to contribute to the open-source version of AIdea, such contributions will be governed by the AGPLv3 and must be made publicly available under the same license.

c. Separation of Components: Certain components of AIdea may be exclusively available under either the AGPLv3 or the Commercial License. Licensees must adhere to the terms applicable to the components they use.

c. Designation of Components: The AIdea project includes various components, some of which may be exclusively available under the AGPLv3, while others may be exclusively under the Commercial License. The main `LICENSE` (AGPLv3) and `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE` documents are located in the root directory, along with a `LICENSE_SPECIFICITIES.md` document detailing a list of component-specific licensing terms. This document, along with specific `LICENSE` files in relevant directories and brief license headers in source files, provides clear guidance on the licensing terms applicable to each component of AIdea.

d. Transition Between Licenses: Transitioning from the AGPLv3 to the Commercial License requires a separate agreement and may necessitate re-licensing of previously developed derivative works under the terms of the Commercial License. Conversely, transitioning from the Commercial License to AGPLv3 is subject to the disclosure and public availability requirements of the AGPLv3.

e. Compliance: Licensees are required to comply with the terms of the chosen license. The Licensor reserves the right to audit and enforce compliance as per the stipulations of the respective license.

9. Termination
The Licensor may terminate this Agreement with cause, or refuse renewal without cause, provided a 90-day notice is given. The Licensee may terminate this Agreement with a 30-day written notice and shall be entitled to a 50% refund of the prorated license fee for the remaining term. Upon termination, the Licensee must cease using the Software by 6 AM UTC the following day.

10. Audit Rights
The Licensor reserves the right to audit the Licensee's use of the Software to ensure compliance with this Agreement.

11. Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution
Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

Dispute Resolution
In the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the parties shall first seek to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiation. If the dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation within thirty (30) days, the parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation in Honolulu, Hawaii. If mediation is unsuccessful, the dispute shall then be resolved by binding arbitration in Honolulu, Hawaii, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

Future Modification
The parties acknowledge that the Licensor intends to establish a legal entity to manage this project in the future. Upon the formation of such an entity, the Licensor reserves the right to modify the terms related to jurisdiction and dispute resolution to reflect the change in legal status.
[To be determined in consultation with legal counsel.]

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.
